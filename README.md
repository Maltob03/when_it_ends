## What's about

When-It-Ends is an innovative website that monitors daily data on vaccinations in Italy and offers a visual indication of progress toward herd immunity. The site features an intuitive and easy-to-use platform that provides users with real-time information on the number of vaccinations being carried out in the country.

Upon arriving at the When-It-Ends homepage, users will be greeted by a dynamic timer that is based on the current pace of vaccinations and calculates a rough estimate of the time needed to achieve herd immunity in Italy. The timer is constantly updated based on official data.


In addition, When-It-Ends offers an interactive section called "Timeline," where each user has the option of sending a message that will appear in this section while waiting to achieve herd immunity.

Users can post short text messages, motivational quotes, pictures or even videos that reflect their confidence and solidarity toward the common goal of mass vaccination. This feature allows users to connect, share their experiences, and feel part of a community committed to the fight against the pandemic.
